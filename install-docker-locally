🐳 Complete Docker Setup & Verification Guide (Windows PowerShell)
1️⃣ Check your Windows version

Docker Desktop requires Windows 10/11 (build 1903 or later).

winver


If it’s 1903+ → ✅ proceed.

2️⃣ Enable WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)

Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:

wsl --install


If this fails on older Windows builds:

dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart


Then restart your system.

3️⃣ Download & Install Docker Desktop

Go to:
🔗 https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

Download Docker Desktop for Windows

Run the installer

✅ Check “Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V”

✅ Check “Add shortcut to desktop” (optional)

Click OK / Install, wait for setup

Reboot when prompted

4️⃣ Start Docker Desktop

Open Docker Desktop from Start Menu

Wait until the whale 🐳 icon in the system tray says:
“Docker Desktop is running”

5️⃣ Verify installation

Open PowerShell and run:

docker --version
docker compose version


✅ Example output:

Docker version 28.4.0, build d8eb465
Docker Compose version v2.39.4-desktop.1

6️⃣ Test Docker Engine

Run the test container:

docker run hello-world


✅ Expected output:

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.


This confirms Docker Engine + Daemon + Networking are all working.

7️⃣ Run a sample Nginx container

Now test a real web service:

docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx


✅ Output (example):

Unable to find image 'nginx:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/nginx
...
Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:latest
dcfb1cf54043...

8️⃣ Verify container is running
docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  STATUS         PORTS                  NAMES
dcfb1cf54043   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.…"   Up 2 minutes   0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   nginx

9️⃣ Access in your browser

Open:
👉 http://localhost:8080

You’ll see:

Welcome to nginx!
“If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and working...”

🎉 That means your Docker setup works perfectly!
